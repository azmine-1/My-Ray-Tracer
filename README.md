## What does it do?

- **Ray Generation:** Generates primary rays from the camera's viewpoint.
- **Ray-Object Intersection:** Computes intersections between rays and objects in the scene (spheres, planes, etc.).
- **Material Rendering:** Implements basic material properties such as diffuse and reflective surfaces.
- **Anti-Aliasing:** Includes techniques to reduce aliasing artifacts in rendered images.

## How to use?

1. **Set up the Scene:**
   Define camera parameters, objects, and materials.

2. **Adjust Rendering Settings:**
   Configure rendering settings for desired quality and performance.



## Problems

- **Limited Rendering Scope:** Supports rendering basic geometric primitives (spheres, planes).
- **Lack of Advanced Features:** Does not include advanced rendering features like global illumination or physically-based materials.
- **Performance Variability:** Performance may vary depending on hardware and scene complexity.
